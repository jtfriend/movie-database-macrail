Movie Database Project for MacRail

01/07/2017

Started looking at what server and stack I will start to use.
Decided on WAMPServer because that's what Lynda.com(where I'm
learning PHP from) is using.

Gone through some basic WAMP stuff, installed everything
and created a simple hello world program to test it, and it
works. Skipped the general PHP learning process to MySQL
to set up the database. Just refreshing things from a web
project I did before.

Ideas:
create a login for a admin to add or change movies in the Database
create a login for normal uses who can search for movies and add comments
JQuery, AJAX, CSS. but don't waste time on CSS

To be able to see what films certain actors are in
