Movie Database Project for MacRail 

01/07/2017

Started looking at what server and stack I will start to use.
Decided on WAMPServer because that's what Lynda.com(where I'm
learning PHP from) is using.

Gone through some basic WAMP stuff, installed everything
and created a simple hello world program to test it, and it
works. Skipped the general PHP learning process to MySQL
to set up the database. Just refreshing things from a web
project I did before.
